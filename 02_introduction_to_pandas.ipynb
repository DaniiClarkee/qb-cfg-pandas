    "Pandas was originally written by [Wes McKinney](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wes_McKinney) who was working at a hedge fund and needed a tool to better deal with the time-series data he was working with day to day. It's a great story for a few reasons:\n",

    "2. He's admitted that when he started the project he wasn't very good at Python. \n",
    "3. This amazing tool used by thousands of people was made by 'just some guy'\n",
